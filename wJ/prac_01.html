<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    it was a busy first week may have left finishing off my site demo a
    bit late, because I over extended myself with other thing but
    beside that content being a bit lacking it was overall a
    good refresher of my css and html knowledge.
</p>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    i started off looking at other people examples of using
    GitHub pages to get a basic understanding on how they worked I then
    moved to waiting vid/ demo before working on my css I didn't do much
    research on html beside looking out some of my old site as most of that
    stack with me.
</p>
<h2>Resources/Links</h2>
<p>
    a good introductory vid for GitHub pages https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k

</p>
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>
    i think I spent around 2 hours messing around with other people
    GitHub page and looking at tutorials
    i than spent about 6 hr on and off working on the site
    and mostly refreshing my css
    8 hr
</p>
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>
    proper implementation of css is key to a good-looking and well working site
    it has many usefully function like flex and grid. make sure to use proper labelling
</p>
<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>
    I work best when I have a plan and when I go out to
    work, I need to motivate myself to head out to a proper
    location where I can concentrate on work, or I just get to easily distracted.
