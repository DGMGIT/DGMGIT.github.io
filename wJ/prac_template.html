<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    i wasn't really sure what I was meant to do for this journal,
    but I assumed it was for the presentation rehearsals which had
    a few difficulty but in the end turned out alright.
</p>

<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    mostly we discussed in our group how we wanted to record it and how to
    split up the different parts once we had that organised we each went
    of to write our scripts, and then we recorded.
    there wasn't really much in the way of learning activity as we used a lot of
    what we already knew

    the hardest part was recoding as we were all in different

    more time on equipment prep.
