<h1>Final Learning Journal</h1>

<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    i wasn't really sure what I was meant to do for this journal,
    but I assumed it was for the presentation rehearsals which had
    a few difficulty but in the end turned out alright.
</p>

<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    mostly we discussed in our group how we wanted to record it and how to
    split up the different parts once we had that organised we each went
    of to write our scripts, and then we recorded.
    there wasn't really much in the way of learning activity as we used a lot of
    what we already knew

</p>

<h2>Resources/Links</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>
    about 6 hr
</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>
    the hardest part
    I also used obs for the first time it prtty cool
</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>
    i found more communication when it came to writing the scrips
    would have been good as we did end up with a little overlap also
    while recoding we had a lot of equipment trouble as we were all
    in different location we had to use video conferencing software
    to record as well as recoding, audion equipment and editing software
    which each comes with their own challenges as such I would suggest more time
    on equipment prep to allow a smother recoding session.
