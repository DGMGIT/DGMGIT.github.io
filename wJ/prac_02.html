<h1>prac 02 journal</h1>
<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    this week was a lot smoother than last, i wasnt as rush althouth
    i did still run into a bii of troblem with the joomla site.
    it seems i must of made a mistake when putting in my email for
    the singup because when i got home after the prac i was unable to regain access to my acccount
    and had to start again it was a lot easier the second time.
</p>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    mostly it was just playing around with the controls on site, i did look up a few tutorial
    but it was mostly just the joomla one and one on extentions but i didnt end up using them, didn't seem worth the
    troble
</p>
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>
    not including the one i spent trying to gain access back into my first site
    6 hr
</p>
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>
    when using only storage for website exspeachily for one which you are using for the first timemake sure you get your
    info right(good organisation is important)
</p>
<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>
    i would just be more carefull when setting up system, i found out pretty fast so it wasn't an issure but it was
    still pretty bad.
