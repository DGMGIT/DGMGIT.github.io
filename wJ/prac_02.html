<h1>prac 02 journal</h1>
<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    this week was a lot smoother than last, i wasn't as rush although
    I did still run into a bit of trouble with the joomla site.
    it seems I must of made a mistake when putting in my email for
    the signup because when I got home after the prac I was unable to regain access to my account
    and had to start again it was a lot easier the second time.
</p>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    mostly it was just playing around with the controls on site, I did look up a few tutorial,
    but it was mostly just the joomla one and one on extensions but I didn't end up using them, didn't seem worth the
    trouble
</p>
<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>
    not including the one i spent trying to gain access back into my first site
    6 hr
</p>
<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>
    when using only storage for website especially for one which you are using for the first time make sure you get your
    info right(good organisation is important)
</p>
<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>
    i would just be more carefully when setting up system, I found out pretty fast, so it wasn't an issue, but it was
    still pretty bad.
