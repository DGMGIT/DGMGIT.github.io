<h1>prac-09</h1>

<h2>Week</h2>
<p>
    i had a lot of trouble with Sass it was just one of those
    thing that doesn't click with me right away, first of all installing
    it took longer than it should (instruction were vague) and
    then setting it up was better but still strange.
</p>

<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>
    same as usual mab a bit more time spent watching YouTube
    videos to find usefully one (most were from over 5 year ago)

</p>

<h2>Resources/Links</h2>
<p>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html">Jetbrains - PhpStorm - Sass, SCSS, and Less</a>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtMgTdjWEuk">IntelliJ and SASS files compile with File watcher</a>
</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>
    over 10 hr I had a lot of problems with this one.
</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>
    i could see Sass being usefully for big project but the backwards
    computability is not there yet, so I wouldn't recommend using it
    in already started project unless you are competent with it even if you
    are staring a new project I would recommend seeing if it is for you first
    before deciding to use it.
</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>
    i feel Sass hasn't been fully integrated into web development
    and has a lot of competition so im not sure if it will end up as
    the goto preprocessor.
